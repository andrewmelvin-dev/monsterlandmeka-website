      <h2>About Monsterland Meka</h2>

      <h3>When will Monsterland Meka be released?</h3>
      <p>This game is under ongoing development and is a personal project only. I’ll demonstrate videos and screenshots from time to time but progress is taking a long time due to the fact I rarely get time to work on this project.</p>

      <h3>Will there be any crowdfunding involved?</h3>
      <p>No. All costs associated with development of this game are personally funded by myself. This is a fan game and a personal hobby, and is not intended to make money.</p>

      <h3>Why are you making this game?</h3>
      <p>I’ve long been a fan of the Monster World series created by SEGA and Ryuichi Nishizawa. After more than 30 years I still remember the first time I saw Monster Land being played, with Bock Lee Temjin fighting his way through Wizard’s Castle. At the time the game was unlike anything I’d ever played. Creating this new game helps me relive the magic of that era, while also helping to improve my skills in modern game development.</p>

      <h3>How is Monsterland Meka being built?</h3>
      <p>The game is being developed using the Unity game development engine. I am primarily a programmer and am not the best on the art and music side. Some assets used in the game have been purchased from the Unity Asset Store, but for the most part the core of the game has been built from scratch.</p>

      <h3>What is different about Monsterland Meka?</h3>
      <p>While Monsterland Meka somewhat follows the story line of the game that inspired it, it is not a level-based game like the original. The game has an open-world format, similar to later games in the Monster World series. In the Metroidvania style many areas that appear inaccessible at first can be revisited later on when new equipment and abilities become available.</p>

      <h3>Who are the heroes?</h3>
      <p>The player can choose to control the traditional hero Bock Lee Temjin, or his childhood friend: Tanya Takaroa. While Bock is a better skateboarder and can cast magic, Tanya is a natural born swimmer, surfer, and is quite skilled with the chakram throwing weapon. Later in the game each hero can gain access to the abilities of the other.</p>

      <h3>Who are the friends?</h3>
      <p>The player must first rescue Princess Purapril, the last member of the Aqua Kingdom royal family known to be alive, and who is being held prisoner by The Red Knight in Wizard’s Castle high above Monsterland City. From there, the player must do what they can in order to rebuild the Aqua Kingdom, track down Purapril’s brother Prince Leo, and gain the power to defeat Meka. The player can call on companions that are hatched from eggs found along the way: Priscilla the fairy, Hotta the dwarf, Shabo the demonic coin-collector, and Junior the juvenile dragon. While seemingly weak at first, these companions can be powered-up and will gain new abilities through battle and exploration.</p>

      <h3>Who are the villains?</h3>
      <p>The Meka Dragon’s alliance consists of Mr Wizard, The Red Knight, and many of Monsterland’s most formidable monsters. Apart from Meka, there are other threats as well: the recently resurrected Demon King of the Woodland Kingdom, the unpredictable Sphinx, and a pirate captain obsessed with black magic to name a few.</p>

      <h3>Will Pepelogoo be in this game?</h3>
      <p>Most certainly! Pepelogoo Stew is one of Sphinx’s favorite meals. It is served in the bistro inside The Pyramid Hotel. The player will need a meal ticket to gain access to the bistro.</p>
